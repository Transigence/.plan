Video Pre-Work Suite

Video Pre-Work Suite is a suite of tools used for cutting, trimming, finding, and prepping, and staging video assets for large projects, while working with very large raw takes.

Some of its base components are in the form of Python scripts which merely make convenient the repeated invocation of ffmpeg. A GUI is planned to help visualize the job and create arguments for the invocations of ffmpeg.
